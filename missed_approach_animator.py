# Missed Approach Animator | Module 007
# Dynamic 3D animation of procedural missed approach track
# Source logic: HG 2.9.1.9.3., IAP Spec 3.3.4.18 â€” ICAO vector path rendering

import numpy as np

# --- Step 1: Define initial approach fix and climb segments
initial_fix = np.array([0, 0, 0])  # Threshold
segments = [
    np.array([0, 0, 100]),
    np.array([20, 0, 150]),
    np.array([40, 10, 200]),
    np.array([60, 25, 250]),
    np.array([80, 40, 300])
]

# --- Step 2: Combine full trajectory path
flight_path = [initial_fix] + segments

# --- Step 3: Print procedural coordinates
print("Missed Approach Flight Track (ICAO RNAV Logic):")
for idx, pt in enumerate(flight_path):
    print(f"Waypoint {idx + 1}: X: {pt[0]} | Y: {pt[1]} | Altitude: {pt[2]} ft")

# Future: Apply RNAV 7-point type with animated vector transitions and hoverable altitude/heading labels
