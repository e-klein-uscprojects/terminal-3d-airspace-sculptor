# Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor

I am a strategic leader in aeronautical data intelligence, predictive analytics, and geospatial modeling, having served in both aviation operations and aerospace intelligence roles. This project reflects my continued pursuit of procedural clarity and spatial transparency across the national airspace system.

The Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor models controlled airspace volumes and terminal boundaries using ICAO definitions and OpenCities reference data. It applies vertical stratification logic and convex hull modeling to produce interactive representations of ADIZ, SUAS, and international sectors. My goal is not merely technical refinement, but operational accountability—ensuring flight planning, navigation, and air traffic coordination tools are built on reliable, open, and intelligent geospatial infrastructure.

Drawing on my experience as a commercial and agricultural pilot, my work in defense applications at Oracle, and my procedural data modeling for Maxar Technologies, this initiative aligns core geospatial expertise with the mission-critical requirements of aerospace safety and precision. My academic background in Communication Analytics from USC has enabled me to integrate sentiment, terrain, and system-level analytics to optimize operational decision-making.

Each module in this repository builds toward a fully rendered 3D navigation and procedure engine—with boundary mapping, missed approach reconstruction, and holding pattern logic—built from the ground up with Python, Open3D, and GIS-enabled frameworks.
