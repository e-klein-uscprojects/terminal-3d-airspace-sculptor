Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor

I am the founder and principal developer of **Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor**, a **geospatial modeling platform** initiated at the **USC Viterbi School of Engineering**. The project was developed in response to a persistent challenge in aviation infrastructure: the lack of **modular**, **interoperable tools** for visualizing and validating **structured airspace procedures** in three dimensions.

From the outset, my goal has been to build a system that not only supports **traditional aviation workflows** but also aligns with the operational needs of **emerging logistics platforms**. In particular, the architecture of **Terminal 3D** was designed with **Amazon** in mind. As the company expands its footprint in **drone delivery**, **automated airspace routing**, and **cloud-based mission planning**, the need for **scalable**, **ICAO-compliant modeling tools** becomes increasingly urgent. **Terminal 3D** addresses this need directly—offering a **procedural engine** capable of simulating **Special Use Airspace envelopes**, **glidepath geometry**, and **obstacle clearance zones** with precision and flexibility.

**Real-World Relevance**  
**Amazon’s Prime Air** initiative underscores the growing demand for **dynamic airspace modeling**—the very challenge **Terminal 3D** was designed to address. As **Amazon** expands its footprint in **drone logistics**, the need for **scalable**, **ICAO-compliant routing** and **procedural envelope simulation** becomes increasingly urgent. **Terminal 3D** aligns directly with this operational vision.

During the development process, I authored a suite of modules that support both **community experimentation** and **enterprise deployment**. These include:

- A **Python-based sculpting engine** for **parametric airspace modeling**  
- **Export pathways** for **OpenCities IFC**, **DXF**, and **OBJ formats**  
- A **real-time API synchronization layer** for **mission planning systems**  
- **Validation dashboards** for **glideslope integrity** and **terrain proximity**  
- A **pilot briefing console** with **immersive altitude annotation tools**  

Each module was designed to operate independently or as part of a larger **procedural framework**. The platform supports **vertical stratification logic**, **convex hull rendering**, and **dynamic missed approach reconstruction**—all built from the ground up using **Open3D**, **GIS-enabled frameworks**, and **modular Python logic**.

**Terminal 3D** is offered under an **Open Core + Enterprise SaaS model**. The **community edition** is freely available to **developers**, **researchers**, and **academic institutions**. **Licensed enterprise modules** are available on a **per-project basis** or via **subscription**, depending on the scope and integration requirements.

The platform has been used to model **ADIZ boundaries**, **SUAS corridors**, and **international sector grids**, and is currently being evaluated for integration into **logistics routing systems** and **airspace planning tools**. Its alignment with **Amazon Web Services infrastructure**, combined with its **procedural fidelity**, makes it a strong candidate for deployment in **Amazon Prime Air operations** and related initiatives.

**What It Is**  
**Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor** is a **parametric modeling environment** for **structured airspace**, **ICAO sectors**, and **instrument flight procedures**. It leverages **geospatial geometry**, **exportable assets**, and **modular logic blocks** to simulate, validate, and visualize aviation procedures at the **sector level**.

**Why It Matters**  
There remains a significant fragmentation between the **CAD environments** used for **procedure design** and the **geospatial platforms** used for **airspace visualization and analysis**. **Terminal 3D** bridges this divide—synchronizing **navaid placement**, **glidepath geometry**, and **obstruction modeling** within a unified system accessible to **planners**, **engineers**, and **decision-makers**.

**Core Features (Free Community Edition)**  
- **Python-based procedural sculpting engine**  
- **Native support** for **OpenCities IFC format**  
- **DXF/OBJ export** for **cross-platform CAD usage**  
- **IFR procedure modeling templates**

**Enterprise Modules (Licensed)**  
- **MicroStation Integration Toolkit**  
- **Glideslope and Obstacle Validation Dashboards**  
- **Live API Sync** for **mission planning and ops alignment**  
- **Documentation utilities** for **operational compliance workflows**

**Use Cases**  
- **Air Navigation Service Providers** validating **IFR procedure geometry**  
- **Airport engineering teams** defining **sector boundaries** and **navaid alignment**  
- **Aerospace contractors** evaluating **obstruction clearance** and **site compatibility**  
- **Cloud logistics platforms** modeling **drone corridors** and **SUAS envelopes**  
- **Amazon Prime Air operations** requiring **dynamic airspace simulation**

**Business Model**  
**Terminal 3D** operates under an **Open Core + Enterprise SaaS model**. **Community access** is free for **developers**, **researchers**, and **academic partners**. **Enterprise modules** are licensed **per project** or offered via **subscription** for **aviation authorities**, **consultants**, and **systems integrators**.

For **integration inquiries**, **enterprise evaluations**, or **technical correspondence**, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this platform and its potential application to your mission.

**Project Initiated**: January 2024

**Problem Tackled**: Current aviation systems lack intuitive, modular 3D visualization tools that support dynamic airspace planning.  
**Entrepreneurial Response**: **Terminal 3D** was developed independently to address this gap through **scalable**, **user-oriented design**.
