# Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor

I am the founder and principal developer of Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor, an open-core platform initiated at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. This tool was developed in direct response to a persistent challenge in aviation infrastructure design: the disconnect between geospatial modeling and CAD-based procedural alignment.

My academic and professional background—paired with a longstanding interest in structured airspace design—has guided the architecture of Terminal 3D. Through successive development cycles, I have authored parametric sector modeling algorithms, implemented export pathways for OpenCities IFC and DXF formats, and built modular templates for IFR route planning. I am writing to formally present the framework and vision of this platform to technical partners and regulatory stakeholders invested in improving procedural accuracy and operational safety across aviation domains.

In addition to the free community edition of Terminal 3D, I have overseen the development of enterprise-grade modules designed to support operational compliance, streamline mission planning, and enable interoperability with industry-standard tools such as Bentley’s MicroStation. These licensed components include glideslope validation dashboards, obstacle profile analysis engines, real-time API synchronization, and tools for documentation generation across procedural workflows.

## What It Is

Terminal 3D Airspace Sculptor is a parametric modeling environment for structred airspace, ICAO sectors, and instrument flight procedures. It leverages geospatial geometry, exportable assets, and modular logic blocks to simulate, validate, and visualize aviation procedures at the sector level.

## Why It Matters

There is a marked fragmentation between CAD environments used for procedure design and the geospatial platforms used for airspace visualization and analysis. Terminal 3D bridges this divide—synchronizing navaid placement, glidepath geometry, and obstruction modeling inside a unified system accessible to planners, decision-makers, and engineers.

## Core Features (Free Community Edition)

- Python-based procedural sculpting engine
- Native support for OpenCities IFC format
- DXF/OBJ export for cross-platform CAD usage
- IFR procedure modeling templates

## Enterprise Modules (Licensed)

- MicroStation Integration Toolkit
- Glideslope and Obstacle Validation Dashboards
- Live API Sync for mission planning and ops alignment
- Documentation utilities for operational compliance workflows

## Use Cases

- Air Navigation Service Providers validating IFR procedure geometry
- Airport engineering teams defining sector boundaries and navaid alignment
- Aerospace contractors evaluating obstruction clearance and site compatibility

## Business Model

Terminal 3D operates under an Open Core + Enterprise SaaS model. Community access is free for developers, researchers, and academic partners. Enterprise modules are licensed per project or offered via subscription for aviation authorities, consultants, and systems integrators.
